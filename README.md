# JS-miniprojects

This is where all of my ongoing Javascript play-projects go.

As of now, there's ColorGame - a point-and-click game where you guess and pick a color (based on a given RGB value amongst a random pool of colors. If you guess correctly, you win. If not, the picked color disappears, leaving other choices still open to play.

Then we have a todo list - it's interactive and animated, built on jquery. Its functionality is self explanatory.

As I build more things, I'll keep adding them here.
